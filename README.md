# pythagoras

Pixel generator based on pythagorean theory : π² = 9.86960440109 + 10.485281374 (the square of the numerator of the golden ratio, or √ 5 ).
= 20.3548857751 then √  20.3548857751 =   4.5116389234

### The first principle.

* We begin with :  pi = 3.14159265359 = pi to 10 decimal places.(the square root of pi = 1.77245385091 and is equal to a given point in space, ie , the first dimension , or the first 'principle').
* and is both without dimension and outside of , prior to or devoid of 'TIME'. In Modern theory it represents that which preceeds the 'BIG BANG'.
* Then : 2.2360679775 ( the numerator of the golden ratio = the square root of 5 +1 ) =3.2360679775 'This represents the actual moment of the big bang, the inception of 'Time'.
* Calculate the Square of both numbers = 9.86960440109  +  10.485281374 
* Create the sum of the two squared numbers. = 20.3548857751 (the number varies slightly depending on the number of decimal places ).
* Calculate the square root of 20.3548857751 
* This gives us our third number =  4.5116389234 (This is Genesis , the first 'extension' in space and time).
* This is the formulae for generating the sequence : ```sqrt(π^2 + (n + 1)^2)``` where n = the numerator of the 'Golden Ratio'.
* This can be said to be the root principle of the 3rd Dimension of space.(As believed by the ancients).
* Which in and of it's self necessitates the 4th dimension of time.
* The formulae , they believed , is the formulea of 'Eternity'.
* As expressed both in the construction of and the riddle of the 'Sphinx'.
* The propagation of 'the sequence' can be percieved by those within the 'coherence theory of truth' as a 'chain-reaction'
* That continues for 'ETERNITY'...
* Ad INFINITUM...

## reciprocal

 The reciprical 0f sqrt(π^2 + (n + 1)^2) = [ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi^2 + (n + 1)^2}} ] 

given that [ n = 2.2360679775 ] (the square root of 5).

 [ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi^2 + (2.2360679775 + 1)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi^2 + 3.2360679775^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi^2 + 10.4721359569}} ]

We Calculate the expression:

\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi^2 + 10.4721359569}} \]

Using the value of \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we have:

\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3.14159^2 + 10.4721359569}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{9.869587132 + 10.4721359569}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{20.3417230889}} \]

Calculating the square root of 20.3417230889 gives approximately 4.50924975222.

Therefore, the reciprocal of \( \sqrt{\pi^2 + 10.4721359569} \) is approximately \( \frac{1}{4.50924975222} \), which evaluates to approximately 0.22164894331.

 \( n = 2.2360679775 \), the reciprocal of \( \sqrt{\pi^2 + (n + 1)^2} \)  = 0.22164894331.
