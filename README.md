### The first principle.

* We begin with :  pi = 3.14159265359 = pi to 10 decimal places.(the square root of pi = 1.77245385091 and is equal to a given point in space, ie , the first dimension , or the first 'principle').
* and is both without dimension and outside of , prior to or devoid of 'TIME'. In Modern theory it represents that which preceeds the 'BIG BANG'.
* Then : 2.2360679775 ( the numerator of the golden ratio = the square root of 5 +1 ) =3.2360679775 'This represents the actual moment of the big bang, the inception of 'Time'.
* Calculate the Square of both numbers = 9.86960440109  +  10.485281374 
* Create the sum of the two squared numbers. = 20.3548857751 (the number varies slightly depending on the number of decimal places ).
* Calculate the square root of 20.3548857751 
* This gives us our third number =  4.5116389234 (This is Genesis , the first 'extension' in space and time).
* This is the formulae for generating the sequence : ```sqrt(Ï€^2 + (n + 1)^2)``` where n = the numerator of the 'Golden Ratio'.
* This can be said to be the root principle of the 3rd Dimension of space.(As believed by the ancients).
* Which in and of it's self necessitates the 4th dimension of time.
* The formulae , they believed , is the formulea of 'Eternity'.
* As expressed both in the construction of and the riddle of the 'Sphinx'.
* The propagation of 'the sequence' can be percieved by those within the 'coherence theory of truth' as a 'chain-reaction'
* That continues for 'ETERNITY'...
