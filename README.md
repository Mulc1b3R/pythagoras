### The first principle.

* We begin with :  pi = 3.14159265359 = pi to 10 decimal places.(the square root of pi = 1.77245385091 and is equal to a given point in space, ie , the first dimension , or the first 'principle').
* and is both without dimension and outside of , prior to or devoid of 'TIME'. In Modern theory it represents that which preceeds the 'BIG BANG'.
* Then : 2.2360679775 ( the numerator of the golden ratio = the square root of 5 +1 ) =3.2360679775 'This represents the actual moment of the big bang, the inception of 'Time'.
* Calculate the Square of both numbers = 9.86960440109  +  10.485281374 
* Create the sum of the two squared numbers. = 20.3548857751 (the number varies slightly depending on the number of decimal places ).
* Calculate the square root of 20.3548857751 
* This gives us our third number =  4.5116389234 (This is Genesis , the first 'extension' in space and time).
* This is the formulae for generating the sequence : ```sqrt(Ï€^2 + (n + 1)^2)``` where n = the numerator of the 'Golden Ratio'.
* This can be said to be the root principle of the 3rd Dimension of space.(As believed by the ancients).
* Which in and of it's self necessitates the 4th dimension of time.
* The formulae , they believed , is the formulea of 'Eternity'.
* As expressed both in the construction of and the riddle of the 'Sphinx'.
* The propagation of 'the sequence' can be percieved by those within the 'coherence theory of truth' as a 'chain-reaction'
* That continues for 'ETERNITY'...
* Ad INFINITUM...

 ## Velocity and magnitude

 As 'finite' creatures , we are doomed to look thru a 'scanner darkly' , to percieve only that which we are capable of percieving.
 In actuality , the 'multiverse' continues to expand at an order of magnitude faster than the speed of light.
 Beyond all human comprehention.Creating both the infinitley large and infinitly small , both backwards and forwards (in and out) simultainiously.
 The pre socratic philosopher @Zeno' was the first human known to have postulated infinitley minute packets of time and space, what today we call 'Quanta'.
 The subatomic particles travell so fast that they are in more than one 'place' at the same 'time'.
 Similar to the hydrogen bonding that makes hydrogen and oxygen become water.
 Matter can niether be created nor destroyed.It exists in a continuum , in a constant state of ' transmutation'.
 As DATA.
 Data is the fundamental condition of the entirety of existence.
